# Android Studio Firebase-ESP32 Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of Android Studio, Firebase, ESP32, and a face recognition machine learning module. It allows you to send messages from an Android app to an ESP32 device using Firebase Realtime Database.

## Features

- Connects Android Studio to Firebase Realtime Database.
- Sends messages from Android app to ESP32 via Firebase.
- ESP32 device receives messages and performs actions accordingly.
- Utilizes a face recognition machine learning module for advanced functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- Android Studio: The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- Firebase Account: Create a Firebase account to set up a project and obtain the necessary credentials.
- ESP32: A microcontroller board capable of connecting to the internet.
- Face Recognition Machine Learning Module: A pre-trained or custom face recognition module.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   
2. Android Studio Setup:

Open the Android Studio project located in the Main folder.
Add the required Firebase dependencies to your app's build.gradle file.
Follow the instructions in the Android Studio section above to connect Android Studio to Firebase.

3. ESP32 Setup:

Open the ESP32 code file in your preferred programming environment (e.g., Arduino IDE).
Customize the code with your Wi-Fi credentials and Firebase project details.
Upload the code to your ESP32 device.

4. Face Recognition Module:

If you have a pre-trained face recognition module, place it in the appropriate directory.
If you need to train your own face recognition module, follow the documentation of your chosen machine learning library.

5. Run the Android App:

Build and run the Android app on a device or emulator.
Use the provided interface (e.g., button) to send messages to the ESP32 via Firebase.
